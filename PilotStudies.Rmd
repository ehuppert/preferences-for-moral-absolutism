#Set-up and Read in Data

You need to install the following packages to run this code:

-here
-tidyverse


```{r setup, include=FALSE}
library(here)
library(tidyverse)

#read in data

pilot_parks <- read.csv(here("pilot_parks.csv"))
pilot_vlab <- read.csv(here("Pilot_vLab.csv"))

```

# Pilot Parks 

# Frequencies of key variables - N = 130

```{r}
#Attitudes about honesty
table(pilot_parks$LyingDV)
#Lying is never okay (5) = 10, 8%
#Lying is rarely okay (4) = 54, 42%
#Lying is sometimes okay (3) = 58, 45%
#Lying is often okay (2) = 6, 5%
#Lying is always okay (1) = 2, 2%
```


# Pilot Virtual Lab (vlab)

#Frequencies of key variables - N = 154

```{r}
#Attitudes about honesty
table(pilot_vlab$attitude)
#Lying is never okay = 15, 10%
#Lying is rarely okay = 74, 48%
#Lying is sometimes okay = 62, 40%
#Lying is often okay = 3, 2%
#Lying is always okay = 0, 0%

#Behavior
table(pilot_vlab$behave)
#Lying is never okay = 10, 6%
#Lying is rarely okay = 87, 56%
#Lying is sometimes okay = 56, 36%
#Lying is often okay = 1, 1%
#Lying is always okay = 0, 0%

#Pubic attitudes about honesty
table(pilot_vlab$public)
#Lying is never okay = 44, 29%
#Lying is rarely okay = 80, 52%
#Lying is sometimes okay = 30, 19%
#Lying is often okay = 0, 0%
#Lying is always okay = 0, 0%

#does the proportion of sometimes stance differ in attitudes and public?
flex_test <- prop.test(x = c(62, 30), n = c(154, 154), correct = TRUE)
flex_test

#does the proportion of the absolute stance differ in attitudes and public?
abs_test <- prop.test(x = c(15, 44), n = c(154, 154), correct = TRUE)
abs_test

#are frequencies for absolute proclamation in personal attitude and public stance significantly diferent?
table(pilot_vlab$attitude, pilot_vlab$public)
summary(table(pilot_vlab$attitude, pilot_vlab$public))
#chisq = 69.85, df = 6, p < .001
 
#cells < 5 so use fisher exact test
chi_test2 <- fisher.test(table(pilot_vlab$attitude, pilot_vlab$public))
chi_test2 # p < .001


```
